# Project 2 - Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.**

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are acceptable.

## Milestone 1

### Target Audience (Milestone 1)
[In this part, write down who your target audience is.]

My target audience are visitors from Cornell University. The target audience will be students, mainly freshman and sophomore, who have never visited the Apple Festival before. They are students who have heard about the event but never participated. I have chosen such target audience because there is a higher chance that the students have not visited the Apple Harvest Festival before.

### Persona (Milestone 1)
[In this part, create a persona that can represent your target audience, and describe him or her in details below.]

James Smith, a 18 year old student student just entering Cornell University, plans on visiting the Apple Festival with his friends. Although he has not visited outside of the campus before, he is very excited to have an opportunity to participate in the festival. He found about the festival on a brochure that was handed out at Campus.

James is a student in the hotel school who has very strong interest in culinary. He is a very ambitious student wanting to learn the culinary behind the festival in detail but also wants to enjoy his time with his friends. James is also the type of person who wants to visit every part of the festival. Not only is he interested in the food, he is curious about the events that are held during the event. He hopes to spend a good few hours during for the Apple Harvest festival. During his free time he likes to cook, listen to music and tour during his free time.

### Needs (Milestone 1)
[Collect your target audience's needs and wants for the website and list them one by one. Come up with several appropriate design ideas on how those needs may be met. In the **Memo** field, justify your ideas and add any additional comments you have. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job. See the example design journey for an example of how you might do this.]

Format:
- Need/Want #1
  - **Needs and Wants** (What does your client and audience need and want?)
    - Wants to visit the festival but does not know how to get there.
  - **Design Ideas and Choices** (How will you meet those needs and wants?)
    - Create a page specifically for directions. The page will consist of directions for mainly buses because cars can use navigations. There will be a direction for north, west, central campus.
    - Include maps and pictures so that the users can easily find the direction to the event.
  - **Memo** (Justify your decisions; additional notes.)
    - Having a page for direction can direct the users easily to the event. The page would also be easier to find.

- Need/Want #2
- **Needs and Wants** (What does your client and audience need and want?)
  - Wants to plan so that everyone can visit.
- **Design Ideas and Choices** (How will you meet those needs and wants?)
  - Create a page that with all events held and the time those events are held.
  - Add pictures of events so that users can decide what event they want to attend.
- **Memo** (Justify your decisions; additional notes.)
  - Creating a easily navigated page can let the target audience to easily plan their visit.

- Need/Want #3
- **Needs and Wants** (What does your client and audience need and want?)
  - Wants to know what kind of food are sold at the festival.
- **Design Ideas and Choices** (How will you meet those needs and wants?)
  - Create a food page.
  - Add pictures of food with reviews by visitors of the festival.
- **Memo** (Justify your decisions; additional notes.)
  - Can advertise the an crucial part of the festival and encourage more people to visit.
  - Web visitors can easily understand the option of food that is offered at the festival.

  Need/Want #4
  - **Needs and Wants** (What does your client and audience need and want?)
    - Wants to know the events and performances held at the festival
  - **Design Ideas and Choices** (How will you meet those needs and wants?)
    - Create a page for events/performances and create section dedicated for each events held at the festival.
  - **Memo** (Justify your decisions; additional notes.)
    - Easier for the users to find the events they want to attend. Diving the page into sections will make the page more visually attractive.

### Sketches / Screenshots / Storyboards (Milestone 1)
[In this part, include the sketches for each of your pages (both desktop and mobile versions). These sketches **must** be done on paper.]

### Additional Design Justifications (Milestone 1)
[If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet P2M1 requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in Milestone 1. Use it wisely. However, you don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey for Milestone 1.]

## Milestone 2

### Task Planning (Milestone 2)
[Plan out your four tasks for Milestone 2 here before doing your user testing]

1. Find how to get to the Apple Festival from North Campus.

2. Find what types of food are sold at the festival.

3. Find when the festival open/closes.

4. Find the events that are held at the festival.

2. Does your user 1 belong to your target audience of the site? (Yes / No)
The first user does belong to my target audience because the user is a freshman who has never visited the Apple Harvest Festival before.

[If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your target audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the target audience?]


### Tasks for User 1 (Milestone 2)
[Report the results for your user's performance on each of your four tasks. You should **describe the task** you ask the user to complete, explain **what the user did**, describe the user's **reaction/feedback** to the design, **reflect on the user's performance**, determine what **re-design choices** you will make. You can also add any additional comments in the **memo** field. See the example design journey for an example of what this would look like.]

### Additional Design Justifications (Milestone 2)
[If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the design journey for Milestone 2, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet P2M2 requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in Milestone 2. Use it wisely. However, you don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the design journey for Milestone 2.]

For my website I decided to create a CSS file for every page because I thought fixing the code will be easier when redesigning my website. Furthermore, creating separate CSS files allows more flexibility because changing the design will not affect other pages.

### Additional Users...
[If you conduct more user tests of your website, copy the sections "User 4" and "Tasks for User 4" to make sections for User 5, User 6, etc. You are not *required* to conduct these additional tests, but you might find them helpful for refining your website.]

[If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet P2 Final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. Use it wisely. However, you don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the final submission design journey.]
